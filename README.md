# PiMath-PWM
As part of MTU's Math Lab, I get to do various projects.  This one implements a sort of Mathematica plugin, if you will, that allows for AC simulation via PWM using a Raspberry Pi in Mathematica.

While there isn't much to see here currently, it will eventually be fully configurable to the point that all that will need to be done is passing in a sinusoid that will scale to the necessary port voltage and permit that sinusoid to be emulated and displayed in a light bulb connected to the circuit.

While this is an approximation of AC circuits, the goal is for it to be an effective tool in teaching students a real-world application of the calculus they are doing by allowing them to form a very simple differential equation with the solution modeled in the form of light brightness, a nice indicator.

We'll see how far I get.
