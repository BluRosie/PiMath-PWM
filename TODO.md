# TODO
1.)  literally make any sort of mathematica plugin that does anything functionally.  this way i get the way that c can interact with mathematica

2.)  start looking in to loops or some equivalent in mathematica.  can something stupid be slapped together that will constantly run something?  will the processor like that at all?

3.)  look into the pi devices the school has and make sure there is a common pin across all of them.  is that even a thing?

4.)  will linux be necessary?

5.)  see where we are at from here
